# Boosting performance of regular expressions
If all you have are the original Stata regular expression functions in your toolkit, 
all text data can look like a nightmare. Even with better regular expression functions, 
the lack of high-quality documentation, guides, and examples makes it more difficult 
to use regular expressions effectively. Have you ever wondered about the differences 
between possessive and greedy expressions? Have you ever wondered how to use positive 
and negative look-ahead and look-behind functionality? Do you find some commands using 
regular expressions taking much longer to execute than you would like? If so, this is 
the talk for you.

During the talk, I will explain how regular expressions work, and what the different 
metacharacters, matching types, look-arounds, and different character classes do, 
describe how to improve the performance of your regular expressions, and describe 
misconceptions along the way.

# Info
This repository contains the slide deck and code used for some of the examples 
included in the talk.
